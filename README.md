What is Xarcade?

At present, gamers and game publishers face many challenges concerning the maintenance of their various in-game balances. These challenges include the two way exchange of their in-game credits, the transfer of the credits from one game to another, the requirement for linked credit cards for in- application purchases, accessibility to digital wallets such as through Google or iTunes, and excessive revenue sharing with digital wallet providers. To solve this issue, we are building Xarcade: a NEM blockchain powered exchange platform for video game in-game credits (the currency in a game), and functions as a “crypto” video game applications store (the Platform and its Services).The objective of Xarcade is to offer a new method of exchanging and handling in-game credits. The Platform is intended to allow video game publishers to maintain their own in-game credits on the NEM blockchain. This is made possible upon after the video game publisher downloads the Xarcade SDK from the platform and integrate it.

The Xarcade platform enables users to exchange, purchase and transfer the in-game credits, which would be accessible from:

(a)	The desktop.

(b)	Mobile devices.

(c)	An in-game browser window. The Platform facilitates the buying of in-game credits and in-game products with XAR, enabling users to purchase “outside” of the game.

The Platform supports game publishers to create an ecosystem of spending and earning by paying through a two-way exchange ability model, and circumvents the requirement of in-app purchases for game points, so that game publishers do not need to rely on payment solutions such as Google/Apple in-app payment solutions.

XAR can be used to buy XEM, however XEM can only be exchanged through the use of XAR, which is effectively the “gateway token,” for all users on the Platform.

XAR can also be purchased on designated exchanges or purchased directly from the Platform. Users must purchase XAR for in-game purchases. Accumulated in-game tokens can be exchanged for XAR.

Platform users may use the NEM universal e-wallet and the SDKs will automatically detect the e-wallet once it is integrated into a publisher’s game.
